# Salary Analysis Project

This project involves querying and analyzing employee salary data stored in a database. The main objective is to extract valuable insights related to employees' compensation, including base pay, overtime, and total pay. This can be useful for understanding pay trends, managing payroll, and making data-driven decisions.

## Features

### 3. Count the Number of Employees
This analysis provides the total number of employees in the database, as well as a count of distinct employees based on unique identifiers.

### 4. Display Unique Job Titles
This feature identifies all unique job titles in the organization and provides a count of how many different titles exist.

### 5. Show Job Titles and Overtime Pay for Employees with High Overtime Pay
This analysis focuses on employees who have an overtime pay greater than 50,000, and shows their job titles and corresponding overtime pay.

### 6. Show the Average Base Pay for All Employees
This feature calculates the average base pay across all employees in the dataset, helping to understand the overall compensation trend.

### 11. Display Employees with Total Pay Between 50,000 and 75,000
This analysis focuses on employees whose total pay falls between 50,000 and 75,000, providing insights into this specific pay range.

### 12. Display Employees with Base Pay Less Than 50,000 or Total Pay Greater Than 100,000
This feature filters employees whose base pay is below 50,000 or whose total pay exceeds 100,000, highlighting pay extremes.

### 13. Show Employees with Total Pay Benefits Between 125,000 and 150,000 and Job Titles Containing "Director"
